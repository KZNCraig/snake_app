The males are usually bright green with light green bellies, whilst the females are light brown with light cream or white bellies. The distinctive features are the large blunt head and enormous eyes. Both male and female Boomslang juveniles are brown above and have cream coloured bellies. The throat may be bright yellow, and the most distinctive feature is a huge bright green eye.",
        "behaviour": "The Boomslang is not aggressive. Instead, it is docile and very reluctant to bite, even if harassed. Given the opportunity, it will always move away from danger. When cornered, it will inflate its throat to a marked degree and display its bright colouration. If further harassed, it may strike or bite, but bites are very rare in Eswatini.",
